✈️ SkyLift Analytics: Airline Revenue & Occupancy Optimization
📌 Project Overview

SkyLift Analytics is a data-driven project focused on analyzing airline operations to improve occupancy rates, pricing strategies, and overall profitability.

The aviation industry faces increasing pressure from rising fuel costs, stricter regulations, and higher operational expenses. This project leverages SQL and Python to uncover actionable insights that help airlines maximize revenue per seat while maintaining efficiency.

🎯 Business Problem

The airline company is experiencing declining profitability due to:

Rising fuel prices and operational costs

Increasing flight taxes and environmental regulations

High labor costs due to a tight job market

🔍 Objective:

Increase seat occupancy rate

Optimize pricing strategy

Improve customer experience

Identify low-performing flights and aircraft

🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset contains airline operational data including:

Flight details

Ticket bookings

Aircraft information

Fare conditions (Economy, Business, Comfort)

Key Tables:

Flights

Boarding Passes

Aircrafts

Ticket Details

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

SQL (SQL Server)

Jupyter Notebook

Data Visualization

🔄 Project Workflow
1. Data Extraction (SQL)

Retrieved structured data from relational database

Performed joins across multiple tables

Aggregated ticket and flight-level data

2. Data Cleaning & Processing (Python)

Handled missing values

Created derived metrics (occupancy rate, revenue per ticket)

Grouped and transformed data for analysis

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed:

Ticket booking trends over time

Revenue patterns

Aircraft performance

4. Feature Engineering

Calculated:

Occupancy Rate = Booked Seats / Total Seats

Average revenue per ticket

Total revenue per aircraft

5. Visualization

Line charts for booking & revenue trends

Bar charts for fare comparison

Aircraft-wise performance analysis

📊 Key Insights
✈️ Aircraft Performance

Aircraft with >100 seats include:

319 (116 seats), 320 (140), 321 (170), 733 (130), 763 (222), 773 (402)

SU9 aircraft generated highest revenue

Reason: Lower ticket pricing → Higher demand

CN1 aircraft generated lowest revenue

Reason: Limited to economy class & lower pricing

📈 Booking & Revenue Trends

Ticket bookings increased steadily over time

Revenue closely follows booking trends

Peak booking days significantly impact total revenue

💺 Occupancy Analysis

Higher occupancy directly increases profitability

Some aircraft operate below optimal capacity

A 10% increase in occupancy rate can significantly boost revenue

💰 Pricing Insights

Business class fares are consistently higher than economy

Extremely low or high prices reduce demand

Balanced pricing strategy is critical

🚀 Business Recommendations

Adjust pricing dynamically based on demand and aircraft type

Focus on improving occupancy in low-performing flights

Optimize aircraft allocation for high-demand routes

Maintain balance between affordability and service quality

📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analysis can help airlines:

Increase revenue per seat

Improve operational efficiency

Make informed pricing decisions

A data-driven approach to occupancy and pricing optimization can significantly enhance profitability while maintaining customer satisfaction.
